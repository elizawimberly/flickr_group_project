### Photos

If the user selects the explore option from the landing page, they are directed to a feed of all the photos in the Flare library. This allows us to feature the interactive photography element of the app.

When a user wants to upload their own photography, while logged in there is cloud icon displayed in the upper right navigation bar. When a user selects this cloud icon they are directed to a photo upload form where they enter basic information related to their photo along with the url or the image and will allow them to post a photo.

Once a user submits their photo information successfully, they are redirected to a photo details page that will feature the photo they have upload.
